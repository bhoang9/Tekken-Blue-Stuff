# Tekken-Blue-Stuff V1.1

+ Frame data app for Tekken 7.
+ Utilizes season 1 frame data pulled from TOOLASSISTED with modifications for season 2.

## Limitations
+ The nature of frame data from TOOLASSISTED mirrors the exact way the game processes it,
meaning there are some inaccuracies.

   * For example, Mishima's Electric has a startup of 14 frames, but the game processes it as
   11f because it comes out of a crouch dash. Other discrepencies like this exist across
   characters with stances.
+ Given the size of each character's collection of GIFs for their moves, they could not all
fit in one Github repo, so only Josie's are pushed as an example.
