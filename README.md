# Tekken-Blue-Stuff V1.1

+ Frame data app for Tekken 7.
+ Utilizes season 1 frame data pulled from TOOLASSISTED with modifications for season 2.

## Features
+ Frame data for all characters excluding DLC characters.
+ GIFs of each move
+ Filtered "Key Moves" for movelists that sorts by Startup Frames, Spin, and Throw

## Limitations
+ The nature of frame data from TOOLASSISTED mirrors the exact way the game processes it,
meaning there are some inaccuracies.

   * For example, Mishima's Electric has a startup of 14 frames, but the game processes it as
   11f because it comes out of a crouch dash. Other discrepencies like this exist across
   characters with stances.
+ Given the size of each character's collection of GIFs for their moves, they could not all
fit in one Github repo, so only Josie's are pushed as an example.

More detailed reasons for why things are implemented can be found on my blog.
